# tic-tac-toe
This paper-and-pencil game can be played more interactively on your computer in two modes:
* Single player (Beat the computer).
* Two player.

**Rules for tic-tac-toe:**
* Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

**Introducing the interface:**
* A board (3x3) will be initially displayed showing the position of each squares.
* Selection of mode: 1. Single player 2. Two player.
* Type in the position where you need to place your X or O when your turn is up.

1. In single player mode, you will beat against computer. Suppose, you are X and computer is O. Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get continuous three Xs in a row or a column or a diagonal. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting there. After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row. You also have to watch where the computer puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. 

2. In two player mode, you play against another player. The rules and strategies remain the same.
